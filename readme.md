This is a very simple minecraft clone made with the godot engine and C#. The project currently features:

- Procedural World Generation with water and trees

- Block breaking and placing

- Water physics

More features are being added

## Running the game

1. Download the repository

2. Open the project.godot file with the godot engine version 4.3 (Make sure you use the .Net version)

3. If there is no build icon next to the play button, create the c# solution by clicking Project -> Tools -> C# -> Create c# solution

4. Click the play button to run the game (the chunks may take some time to load on start)
